Contains Files for analyzing and outputting Twin Cities traffic data

These files are for use in R.  The code is designed to output traffic data, comparing data from 2019, 2020, and 2021.  I uploaded some data file as excel spreadsheets, and the
code is designed to be used with these spreadsheets.  I also uploaded a picture of a map of the Twin Cities, that is used as the background and plotted over
in some code.  This is to create a 'heatmap' comparing the volumes of traffic in 2021 with 2019, overlaid over a map of the Twin Cities.
